🧠 Design Decisions & Assumptions

Inventory is modeled as a relationship between Product and Warehouse

SKU is globally unique

Low-stock alerts are triggered only for products with recent sales

Threshold varies by product type

Sales velocity determines days until stockout

One primary supplier per product (extendable)

📈 Future Improvements

Role-based access control (Admin, Manager)

Background jobs for alerts & notifications

Pagination & filtering for APIs

Cloud deployment (AWS / GCP)

Frontend dashboard (React)
